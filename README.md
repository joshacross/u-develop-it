## Description
U Develop It is the back-end development of a user voting application that allows the user to vote for several candidates and auto_increments unique ids totals votes per candidate and their respective party. This application uses a fully dedicated mySQL server that runs several SQL queries using node and express.JS and Create, Read, Update, and Delete methodologies. 

* Database and table creation using mySQL Shell

* Performed CRUD operations on a table using `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`

* Connected to mySQL database from Node.JS

* Used Express.js API routing to execute SQL queries

* Tested GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes using Insomnia Core

* Allowed changes to database schema using DROP statements

* Combined relational data using JOIN statements

* Added constraints to remove references to delete data

* Organized code by modularizing API routes in seperate JS files

* Implemented SQL timestamps to track data upon creation

* Used `ORDER BY` clauses to sort data alphabetically and numerically

* Counted votes from a table using SQL `COUNT()` and `GROUP BY` syntax

* Handled defunct votes using `UNIQUE` and `CASCADE` constraints
